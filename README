This is the carduino server project.

It consists of two parts:
- src/: The server back end, responsible for communicating with the race track
  and publishing results to web front end.
- web/: The web based front end showing realtime telemetry data.


How to get started:

--- Install git and clone the git repo of the Carduino-server:
sudo apt-get git
